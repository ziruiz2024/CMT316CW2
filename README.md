# CV-2: Fine-grained image classification (Dogs) Repository

### 1. Download dataset from http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/
### 2. Download models from https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-f37072fd.pth
### 3. Run main.ipynb

To run the code, ensure the working directory is in the following structure

```
{working directory}/
    Annotation
    Images
    lists/
        test_list.mat
        train_list.mat
        file_list.mat        
    main.ipynb
    resnet18-f37072fd.pth
```

Then, open `main.ipynb` and run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or other compatible software.
